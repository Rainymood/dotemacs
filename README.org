* Dotemacs (.emacs)
** What does it look like?

** What is Emacs? 
Emacs is a free (as in freedom) open source text editor.  

This repository contains my =.emacs= file which is the main config file for
Emacs. 

I have tried to keep my =.emacs= file as clean and well-documented as
possible, but I have to admit I am not that knowledgeable in Lisp and so my
=.emacs= contains code that I shamelessly copied without understanding. 

** Emacs vs Vim
As is obvious from the large amount of =evil= bindings, I come from
Vim. After a stint of Spacemacs (which I didn't like) I switched
to Emacs completely solely for org-mode and I don't regret a thing. 
Both Vim and Emacs have great features so why not take the best of
both of worlds? 

** Some interesting parts 
Instead of having you trudge through my whole =.emacs= I would like to show you
some pieces of my configuration file that you might find interesting. 

Bind =C-x v= to open =.emacs=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
;; Bind =C-x v= to open ~/.emacs, remnant from my Vim times where
;; =<Leader> v= would open my ~/.vimrc
(global-set-key (kbd "\C-xv") (lambda () (interactive)
  (find-file "~/.emacs")
  (message "Opened:  %s" (buffer-name))))
#+END_SRC

For some reason =C-u= (which is half a page up in Vim-speak) doesn't
for by default. I think it has to do with Emacs having =C-u= as an
important pre-fix. This fixes that
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Makes C-u scroll up (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14302171/ctrlu-in-emacs-when-using-evil-key-bindings)
(setq evil-want-C-u-scroll t)
#+END_SRC

And possibly the most important one is this one: Vim-like paragraph
movements don't work out of the box. This creates that Vim-like
paragraph feel which we all know and love
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Make evil paragraphs behave like vim paragraphs
;; See: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38596/make-evil-paragraphs-behave-like-vim-paragraphs
(with-eval-after-load 'evil
  (defadvice forward-evil-paragraph (around default-values activate)
    (let ((paragraph-start (default-value 'paragraph-start))
          (paragraph-separate (default-value 'paragraph-separate)))
      ad-do-it)))
#+END_SRC
