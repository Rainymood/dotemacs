* .emacs

Emacs is a free (as in freedom) open source text editor.  This
repository contains my =.emacs= file which my configurations settings
for Emacs.

I have tried to keep my =.emacs= file as clean and well-documented as
possible, but I have to admit I am not that knowledgeable in Lisp ... so I
have to admit that I have shamelessly copy pasted some code that I do not
understand in my =.emacs=.

As is obvious from the large amount of =evil= bindings, I come from
Vim. After a stint of Spacemacs (which I didn't like) I switched
to Emacs completely solely for org-mode and I don't regret a thing. 

Both Vim and Emacs have great features so why not take the best of
both of worlds?
